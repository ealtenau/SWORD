# SWORD Development
The development directory contains scripts used in the intial development of the SWORD database. SWORD development consists of 3 main components:
1) Pre-processing of data sources (/preprocessing_scripts).
2) Merging data source attributes (/merging_databases).
3) Defining reaches and nodes (/reach_definition).

A detailed description of the scripts and how to implement them is cataloged in the [SWORD Development Program Document] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OnYz-my5EqORbvC9OdZ3rGpqB8k1VziJ/view?usp=sharing)
