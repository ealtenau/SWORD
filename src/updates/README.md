# SWORD Updates
SWORD is a continuosly evolving database that requires updates based on feedback from the SWOT Alorithm Team and end users. There is no need to rederive SWORD's entire structure (as detailed in the **/development** directory) for improvements, therefore, the **/updates** directory contains scripts and modules necessary for repetitive and/or bespoke updates to SWORD.
